# Important
I followed this [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/) that was recommended by **Mohammed**. The **results** are fruitful and encouraging. I know that the structure of code / syntax can be confusing, I also struggled understanding some concepts but with practice I'm understanding it. I urge to practice as well for a fruitful contribution.

#### Note - the main code is in the app folder.
